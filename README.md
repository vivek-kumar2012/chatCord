Realtime Chat Application With Rooms.

Welcome to my real-time chat application! 

Platform is designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO. 

We have implemented a room functionality that allows users with similar interests to join share rooms for more effective and engaging conversations.
